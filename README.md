## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter** is required to build the app for both Android and iOS. To install Flutter, follow the instructions on the official Flutter website: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Android SDK** is needed to develop and run the app on Android devices. The Android SDK is included with Android Studio. Download and install **Android Studio**: [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Once you have Flutter and the required SDKs installed, run `flutter doctor` to check for any missing dependencies and verify your environment setup.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMWen/pantry_app.git
   cd pantry_app
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
Simply run
```bash
flutter pub get
```

Examples are:
- Hive for local storage
- `flutter_file_dialog` for importing/exporting files
- `build_runner` for code generation

3. To generate necessary files for Hive, run the following:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

4. To customize the app's launcher icon, you can use the `flutter_launcher_icons` package. Update `flutter_launcher_icons.yaml` accordingly then run the following command to generate icons for your app:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

5. Once you're ready to release the app, you can generate a release APK using the following commands:

For android:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

For iOS (need to create an an iOS Development Certificate in Apple Developer account):
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

#### Troubleshooting iOS Code Signing Issues
If you encounter the "No valid code signing certificates were found" error when building for iOS, follow these steps to fix it:

- Open Xcode: Open your iOS project in Xcode (ios/Runner.xcworkspace).
- Configure Code Signing: Ensure you have the correct signing settings:
    - Set the Team under the Signing & Capabilities tab.
    - Make sure Automatically manage signing is checked.
    - Set the correct Bundle Identifier.
- Certificates: Ensure you have valid certificates for signing in your Apple Developer account.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: The app is built using Flutter for a cross-platform mobile experience, targeting both Android and iOS devices.
- **Hive**: A lightweight, fast key-value database used for local storage, storing pantry items offline.
- **Flutter File Dialog**: Used to open and save files (for importing and exporting data).
